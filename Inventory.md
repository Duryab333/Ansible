# Inventory

Ansible inventory file is a fundamental component of Ansible that defines the hosts (remote systems) that you want to manage and the groups those hosts belong to. The inventory file can be static (a simple text file) or dynamic (generated by a script). It provides Ansible with the information about the remote nodes to communicate with during its operations.
Make an inventory file 

## Static Inventory

```
vim inventory.ini
```

add mannage nodes in it 

```
username@<Ip-Address>
username@<Ip-Address>

```
or 
```
[group-name]
username@<Ip-Address>
username@<Ip-Address>

[group-name]
username@<Ip-Address>
username@<Ip-Address>

````

to see if you are able to access your mannage nodes from control node do ping on all 

```
ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping all
```

or by group

```
ansible -i inventory.ini -m ping <group-name>
```
